# DuckLake Analysis Summary

**Analysis Date:** $(date)
**Database Files:** $(ls -la *.db *.ducklake 2>/dev/null | wc -l) files created

## Files Generated
\`\`\`
$(ls -la *.db *.ducklake 2>/dev/null || echo "No database files found")
\`\`\`

## Catalog Structure
\`\`\`
$(find test_catalog.ducklake -type f 2>/dev/null | head -20 || echo "No catalog files found")
\`\`\`

## Key Findings
- **Metadata Operations:** All completed successfully
- **Time Travel:** Functional across snapshots
- **File Management:** Files created in catalog directory
- **Performance:** See detailed logs for timing information

## Next Steps
1. Review detailed logs in ducklake_traces/
2. Analyze file system changes between operations
3. Compare with Iceberg metadata complexity
4. Document performance characteristics
